# Project Context for Claude

## Project: Personalized Learning Path Generator (PLPG)

## Current Task: Create Jira Stories

### What's Done
- PRD created: `DOCS/prd.md`
- Architecture doc: `DOCS/architecture (2).md`
- Project brief: `DOCS/brief.md`
- 9 Epic files created in `DOCS/`:
  - epic-0-technical-foundation.md
  - epic-1-authentication.md
  - epic-2-onboarding.md
  - epic-3-roadmap-engine.md
  - epic-4-dashboard.md
  - epic-5-progress.md
  - epic-6-recalculation.md
  - epic-7-billing.md
  - epic-8-content.md
- 15 Story markdown files in `DOCS/stories/`:
  - Epic 0: stories 0.1 through 0.12 (12 stories)
  - Epic 1: stories 1.1 through 1.3 (3 stories)

### What Needs To Be Done

1. **Create remaining story markdown files** for:
   - Epic 2 (Onboarding) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 3 (Roadmap Engine) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 4 (Dashboard) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 5 (Progress) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 6 (Recalculation) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 7 (Billing) - check epic file for story list
   - Epic 8 (Content) - check epic file for story list

2. **Create Epics and Stories in Jira** using Atlassian MCP tools:
   - First: Ask user for Jira Project Key (e.g., "PLPG" or whatever their project is called)
   - Create 9 Epics in Jira
   - Create all stories under their respective epics
   - Use story markdown files as source for descriptions

### Jira Configuration
- Atlassian URL: https://3pillarglobal.atlassian.net
- User: saksham.bhardwaj@3pillarglobal.com
- MCP Server: atlassian (configured in ~/.claude.json)

### Instructions for Next Session
When user says "continue with Jira stories":
1. Read this file for context
2. Check if Atlassian MCP tools are available (look for jira_create_issue, jira_search, etc.)
3. Ask user for the Jira Project Key
4. Read each epic file to get story details
5. Create epics first, then stories linked to epics
6. Also create remaining story markdown files locally
