## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

**User Goals:**
- Enable career pivoters to get a personalized, time-bound learning roadmap in under 5 minutes
- Reduce "decision paralysis" by answering What, When, How Long, and Where to learn
- Skip content users already know through intelligent prerequisite mapping
- Provide realistic completion timelines based on weekly availability
- Increase learning path completion rates to 2-3x industry average (>15% vs <15%)

**Business Goals:**
- Validate product-market fit with >40% Phase 1 completion rate
- Achieve $50K MRR by Month 12 with >5% free-to-paid conversion
- Establish first-mover advantage in time-aware personalized learning paths
- Build defensible moat through user completion data (10,000+ data points)
- Prove time estimation accuracy (<20% variance)

**Technical Goals:**
- Deliver responsive web MVP within 3-month timeline
- Implement DAG-based skill sequencing engine
- Implement self-hosted JWT authentication with bcrypt, mock payments (Stripe-compatible), and console logging analytics
- Achieve <2s page load, <3s roadmap generation, 99.5% uptime

### 1.2 Background Context

The gap between current workforce competencies and required skills is widening rapidly, with 44% of essential skills disrupted by automation/AI and 87% of executives expecting significant skill gaps. Traditional learning solutions cause "decision paralysis"—learners face thousands of courses with no clear guidance on where to start, resulting in industry-wide completion rates below 15%.

PLPG (Personalized Learning Path Generator) addresses this by functioning as a "GPS for career transitions"—an orchestration layer that sits above content platforms to intelligently curate, sequence, and schedule existing resources into personalized, time-bound roadmaps. Unlike content-first platforms (Coursera, LinkedIn Learning) or enterprise LMS tools (Cornerstone, Degreed), PLPG is roadmap-first, answering the four critical questions learners need: **What** to learn, **When** (sequence), **How Long** (duration), and **Where** (best resources).

The MVP focuses on a single career path ("Backend Developer → ML Engineer") to validate the core value proposition before expanding. Target users are career pivoters—mid-career professionals (28-42 years old) with 10-15 hours/week for learning, willing to pay $29/month for a solution that eliminates ambiguity and provides accountability.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1 Repository Structure

**Strategy:** Monorepo using npm workspaces (local-first, simplified)

```
plpg/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                 # React frontend (Vite)
│   └── api/                 # Backend API (Express.js)
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/              # Shared types, utilities, Prisma
│   └── roadmap-engine/      # DAG logic, time calculation
├── podman/                  # Podman configs for local services
└── docs/                    # Documentation
```

**Rationale:** npm workspaces is built into Node.js, requires no extra tooling, and enables code sharing between frontend and backend with unified development workflow.

### 4.2 Service Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Hosting |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Client** | React SPA (TypeScript + Vite) | Local dev server (localhost:5173) |
| **API** | Node.js/Express | Local dev server (localhost:3001) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Podman container (localhost:5432) |
| **Cache** | Redis | Podman container (localhost:6379) |
| **Email** | MailHog | Podman container (localhost:8025) |

**API Structure:**
```
/api/v1
├── /auth          # JWT authentication endpoints
├── /users         # User profile management
├── /onboarding    # Onboarding flow data
├── /roadmap       # Roadmap generation & retrieval
├── /progress      # Progress tracking & updates
├── /subscription  # Subscription management (mock)
└── /skills        # Skills and resources
```

### 4.3 Technology Stack

| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Frontend Framework** | React 18 + TypeScript | Industry standard; strong ecosystem |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI | Rapid development; consistent design |
| **State Management** | TanStack Query + Zustand | Server state + minimal client state |
| **Build Tool** | Vite | Fast HMR; modern bundling |
| **Backend Runtime** | Node.js 20 LTS | JS ecosystem alignment |
| **API Framework** | Express.js | Lightweight; well-documented |
| **ORM** | Prisma | Type-safe queries; migration management |
| **Authentication** | JWT + bcrypt | Self-hosted; no external dependencies |
| **Payments** | Mock Stripe (local) | Simulate billing for development |
| **Logging** | Pino | Structured JSON logs; dev-friendly |
| **Email** | Nodemailer + MailHog | Local email testing; no external service |

### 4.4 Testing Requirements

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Tools |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Unit Tests** | ≥70% critical paths | Vitest (frontend), Jest (backend) |
| **Integration Tests** | API endpoints | Supertest |
| **E2E Tests** | Core user flows | Playwright |
| **Visual Regression** | Component library | Chromatic (optional) |

**Critical Paths Requiring Tests:**
- User registration and authentication flow
- Onboarding completion and roadmap generation
- Module completion and progress calculation
- Subscription purchase and paywall enforcement
- Timeline recalculation logic

### 4.5 Database Schema Assumptions

**Core Entities:**
| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `users` | User accounts with profile data |
| `onboarding_responses` | Current role, target role, time budget |
| `skills` | Skill definitions with prerequisites (DAG) |
| `roadmaps` | Generated personalized roadmaps |
| `modules` | Learning modules within roadmaps |
| `resources` | Curated learning resources |
| `progress` | User progress on modules/resources |
| `subscriptions` | Stripe subscription data |
| `events` | Analytics event log |

**DAG Implementation:** Skills stored as adjacency list with `skill_id` and `prerequisite_skill_id` columns for prerequisite relationships.

### 4.6 Local Service Configuration

| Service | Purpose | Local Implementation |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Authentication** | User auth | JWT + bcrypt (self-hosted) |
| **Database** | Data storage | PostgreSQL (Podman container) |
| **Cache** | Session storage | Redis (Podman container) |
| **Email** | Notifications | Nodemailer + MailHog (Podman) |
| **Logging** | Error tracking | Pino logger + error middleware |

### 4.7 Environment Configuration

| Environment | Purpose | Database |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Development** | Local development | PostgreSQL via Podman (localhost:5432) |

**Configuration Management:** Environment variables via `.env` files. All services run locally via Podman Compose. No external cloud dependencies required.

### 4.8 Performance Assumptions

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Initial Page Load** | <2s (LCP) | Lighthouse |
| **Roadmap Generation** | <3s | API latency monitoring |
| **API Response (p95)** | <500ms | Pino logs |
| **Database Queries** | <100ms average | Query analysis |
| **Concurrent Users** | 1,000 without degradation | Load testing |

### 4.9 Development Workflow

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |
| **Local Services** | Podman Compose for PostgreSQL, Redis, MailHog |
| **Hot Reload** | Vite (frontend), tsx (backend) |
| **Database Migrations** | Prisma migrate; run before development |

## 8. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Architecture Review**
   - UX Expert to create detailed wireframes/mockups
   - Architect to finalize tech stack decisions
   - Create architecture document with data models

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Break epics into sprint-sized stories
   - Estimate story points
   - Define Sprint 0 scope (E0 Technical Foundation - prerequisite to all)

3. **Content Curation**
   - Begin curating Backend Dev → ML Engineer resources
   - Create seed data for skills and prerequisites
   - Verify resource links and estimate times

### Phase 1 Implementation Order

| Sprint | Epics | Goal |
|--------|-------|------|
| Sprint 0 | E0 | Technical Foundation - monorepo, packages, testing, CI/CD |
| Sprint 1 | E1, E7, E8 (parallel) | Auth features, billing setup, content seeded |
| Sprint 2 | E2 | Onboarding flow |
| Sprint 3 | E3 | Roadmap engine with content integration |
| Sprint 4 | E4, E5 | Dashboard, progress tracking |
| Sprint 5 | E6, E9 | Recalculation, analytics |

**Note:** After Sprint 0, E1/E7/E8 can be developed in parallel by different developers since they share no dependencies beyond the foundation.
